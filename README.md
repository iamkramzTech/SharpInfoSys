# SharpInfoSys
SharpInfoSys is an open-source C# WinForms Information System template that uses SQLite as its database engine. It’s designed to be simple, lightweight, and easy to extend —making it ideal for students, hobby projects, and small business applications. By leveraging SQLite, the project avoids complex setup requirements: the database is file-based, zero-configuration, and portable, so you can run the system without needing a separate server. This makes SharpInfoSys a practical starting point for learning, prototyping, or building desktop information systems that just work out of the box.
